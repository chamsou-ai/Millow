   git clone https://github.com/chamsou-bit/Millow.git
   cd Millow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile smart contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

   4. **Deploy smart contracts:**

   Update the `hardhat.config.js` with your network and account information, then run:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network your-network
   ```

5. **Deploy smart contracts:**

   Update the `hardhat.config.js` with your network and account information, then run:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

6. **Start the frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts for Millow are written in Solidity and are responsible for handling property listings, purchases, and ownership transfers. The main contracts include:

- **PropertyListing.sol:** Manages property listings and purchases.
- **OwnershipRegistry.sol:** Keeps track of property ownership.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with React.js and interacts with the Ethereum blockchain via Web3.js or Ethers.js. Key components include:

- **PropertyList.js:** Displays all listed properties.
- **PropertyDetail.js:** Shows details of a specific property.
- **AddProperty.js:** Form to list a new property.
- **PurchaseProperty.js:** Handles the property purchase process.

## Usage

1. **List a Property:**

   Navigate to the "Add Property" section, fill out the form with property details, and submit.

2. **View Properties:**

   Browse the listed properties on the home page or use the search functionality to find specific properties.

3. **Purchase a Property:**

   Select a property, view its details, and proceed to purchase using your Ethereum wallet.
